# RudderStack Data Viewer Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension for reading and displaying RudderStack-related data stored temporarily in **Local Storage**. It processes the stored JSON data (such as beautifying the JSON) and presents **RudderStack events** like `track` events in a **popup or side panel**.
This extension was initially developed with the help of **ChatGPT** and **Claude**. While it is functional, there is significant room for improvement in terms of performance, accuracy, and additional features.

## Features
- ðŸ“Œ Reads RudderStack data from **Local Storage**.
- ðŸ“Œ Beautifies JSON data for better readability.
- ðŸ“Œ Displays `track` events inside a **popup** or **side panel**.
- ðŸ“Œ Helps debug and monitor RudderStack event flow in real time.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rudderstack-extension.git
   ```
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right corner).
4. Click on **Load unpacked** and select the extension folder.

## Known Issues & Possible Improvements

### 1. Missing the 10th Event (Batch Completer)
- Since the extension reads from **Local Storage**, the **10th event**, which completes a batch, does not get stored in Local Storage and is therefore missing in the extension.
- A potential fix is to **catch outgoing batch requests** and extract the missing event from there. However, implementing this requires additional work beyond the current scope.

### 2. List Updates in Popup
- The event list updates only while the **popup is open**.
- A possible solution is to use a **Service Worker** and `background.js` to keep the event list updated even when the popup is closed.

### 3. Shared Data Across Multiple Tabs
- Since **Local Storage is shared across all tabs** of the same website, if multiple tabs are open, the displayed data may be mixed.
- Some handling has been implemented in the code to mitigate this, but further improvements are needed to ensure accurate tab-specific data separation.
